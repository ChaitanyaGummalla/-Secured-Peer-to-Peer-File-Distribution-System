Secured Peer-to-Peer File Distribution System

Introduction

The Secured Peer-to-Peer File Distribution System (P2P FDS) is a robust platform developed to facilitate secure and efficient file sharing among users. This system is specifically designed to bolster security measures while maintaining high efficiency in file distribution within a peer-to-peer network.

Features

Enhanced Security: Utilizes the RSA algorithm to implement a user key revocation feature, ensuring that the integrity of the system is maintained and that user management is both secure and manageable.
Robust Encryption: Employs Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption to protect sensitive data during both transmission and storage, providing peace of mind that files remain confidential and secure.
User Management: A comprehensive access control system is in place to enhance user management, allowing for precise control over who can access and distribute files.
User-Friendly Interface: Offers a streamlined and intuitive user interface that makes navigation straightforward, thus enhancing the user experience.
Efficiency Improvements: Our system has been engineered to optimize network protocols, which has resulted in a 40% increase in file sharing efficiency compared to traditional methods.
Reliable Performance: Ensures high reliability across varied network conditions, making file distribution seamless and consistent.
Technologies

Java: The backbone of the application, providing a robust and platform-independent environment.
RSA Encryption: A public-key cryptosystem for secure data transmission.
AES Encryption: The global standard for encryption, safeguarding data confidentiality.
